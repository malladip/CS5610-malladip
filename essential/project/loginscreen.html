        <h2>About Login Screen:</h2>

        <hr />

        <p>The login screen is the page where the functionality starts.</p>
        <p>Here there are multiple options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Login:</h4>

                <p>
                    A registered user can login from here. His username and password will go back to the server through the service
                    and check the authenitcation through PassportJS. If the user is authenticated, a new session is created and the user data is returned.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a screen shot of the login screen:</p>
                <img src="../images/project/login screen.png" />

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Forgot Password:</h4>

                <p>
                    The user may also recover his password. He has 2 options.
                    Either he can ask for the system to e-mail the password or you can reset the password by
                    answering the security questions.
                </p>
                <p>For using either of the options, the user need to verify his Email Id after registering.</p>
                <p>Screen shot:</p>
                <img src="../images/project/forgot password.png" />

                <h4>Recover password using email</h4>
                <p>
                    Recovering password through email, requires the user to enter his username and click the button.
                    A mail will be sent giving his password back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system will show an error when a user who did not verify his email tries to recover.
                </p>
                <p>Screen shot:</p>
                <img src="../images/project/forgot password email.png" />

                <h4>Recover password using security question</h4>
                <p>
                    The second method of recovering a forgotten password is by resetting the password after answering
                    the security question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here when the user enters his username and clicks the button, he gets the security question.
                </p>
                <p>Screen shot:</p>
                <img src="../images/project/forgot password reset 1.png" />
                <p>
                    The user should answer the security question correctly to reset his password, else an
                    error message is displayed.
                </p>
                <p>Screen shot:</p>
                <img src="../images/project/forgot password reset 2.png" />
                <p>When ever a user changes his password, a e-mail will be sent saying they the password was changed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Register:</h4>

                <p>The user must enter all the fields to get registered.</p>
                <p>
                    When the user registers, a verification link will be sent to the email. On clicking on this link,
                    the user's email will be verified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On registering, the system automatically logs him in and creates a session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The registration page looks like this:
                </p>
                <img src="../images/project/registration page.png" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Go For Free:</h4>
                <p>
                    This is for a user who do not wish to register into the system, but still wishes to use the
                    system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A free user does not have access to all the features of the system. For example, he can not use the email
                    widget or he can not save his current position of the widgets.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Admin Login:</h4>
                <p>
                    The admin logs into the system by clicking on the admin login button at the bottom left corener of the
                    login screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He gets the login screen as shown below:
                </p>
                <img src="../images/project/admin login.png" />
                <p>
                    The username and password goes to the server to check the authentication and comes bac with success or error message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the details are correct, he logs into the system, else an error message is displayed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Lock Screen:</h4>
                <p>
                    The user can go back to the lock screen from the login screen by clicking on the icon at the
                    bottom right corner of the screen.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <div>
            <h4>Implementation:</h4>
            <p>
                All the popups in the screen are developed using the ngDialog.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the data goes to the server through the service and comes back with a success or error message.
            </p>
            <p>
                The passportJs and express sessions are used for handling authentication and sessions.
