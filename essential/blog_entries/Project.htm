<h2>Week 13 and 14</h2>

<p>
    In the last 2 weeks of the semester, I concentrated completely on my project.
</p>

<p>
    I started off with analysing the data required to be stored and the format of storing the data.
</p>

<p>
    Later I created the schema using mongoose and mongodb and moved on to the User Interface.
</p>

<p>
    Created the widgets home page, login page and the lock screen and other miscellaneous functionalities. 
</p>

<p>
    After completion of the project, pushed it into <a href="http://widgets-malladip.rhcloud.com/">openshift server</a>
    and worked on <a href="../story/index.htm?../project/story.txt">documentation</a> of the project.
