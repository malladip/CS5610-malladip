<h2>Week 10</h2>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/nodeJS/public/003-Experiment.html">first experiment</a> is about using MongoDb and creating a login and register page.
</p>

<p>
    As my <a href="../Experiments/nodeJS/public/004-Experiment.html">second and third experiment</a> I extended the first experiment, to make the login and register safe by using PassportJS.
</p>

<p>
    I started off with my project by crating a toolbar whose position is adjustable. Click <a href="../Experiments/Project/Toolbar.html">here</a> to read more.
</p>

<p>
    Later, I made a sample view of the project with some widgets. Click <a href="../Experiments/Project/002-widgetsExperiment.html">here</a> to read more.
