<h2>Blog for HTML & CSS Experiments</h2>

<p>
    In the first 2 weeks of the course, I started off by installing the requires softwares and expeienting with basic HTML tags and CSS.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="../Experiments/HTML/BasicTags.html">first experiment</a>, I used various HTML tags for formattinfg text like
    &lt;b>, &lt;i> etc. I learnt different styling methods of ordered and unordered lists. Apart from this, I experimented with iFrames and image tags.
</p>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/HTML/AnchorTag.html">second experiment</a> is about the anchor tag. Here I learnt how to open a link in a new tab and in current tab. I also experimented on navigating to a different part of the current page.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="../Experiments/HTML/InputFields.html">third experiment</a> I practiced of various input fields like text fields, radio box, check box, date field etc.
</p>

<p>
    My idea for <a href="../Experiments/HTML/SemanticTags.html">fourth experiment</a> is to use different HTML 5 semantic tags. Built a page using the semantic tags.
</p>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/CSS/BorderLayoutUsingFloat.html">fifth experiment</a> is on CSS. Here I tried to build a border layout using float tag.
