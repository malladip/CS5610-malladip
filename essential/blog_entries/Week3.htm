<h2>Week 3</h2>

<p>
    In the <a href="../Experiments/JavaScript_Bootstrap/CalsiResponsiveExperiment.html">first experiment</a> I created a calculator with a responsive design.
</p>

<p>
    I extended the first experiment into <a href="../Experiments/JavaScript_Bootstrap/CalciJSExperiment.html">second experiment</a>. Here I implemented the functionality of the calculator using JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/JavaScript_Bootstrap/001-ChromeHomePageExperiment.html">third experiment</a> is about using bootstrap grid system. Here i used used bootstrap grid system and jumbotron tags to create a page simillar to the google chrome new tap page.
</p>

<p>
    I tried draggable contents in my <a href="../Experiments/JavaScript_Bootstrap/002-DraggableTextExperiment.html">fourth experiment</a>. This experiment is all about adding new elements and removing elements in the DOM.
</p>

<p>
    I worked on mouse hover events in my <a href="../Experiments/JavaScript_Bootstrap/003-HoverMouse.html">fifth experiment</a>. I used java script to dynamically change different properties of the elements.
