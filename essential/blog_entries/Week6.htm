<h2>Week 6</h2>

<p>
    I made a magnifying glass in my <a href="../Experiments/JQuery/006-MagnifyingGlass.html">first experiment</a> This conceptis used in many online shopping websites.
</p>

<p>
    I practiced more on the basic angularJS ng directives in my <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/006-AddingNotes.html">second experiment</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I started off with angularJs routing in my <a href="../Experiments/AngularRouting/001-ContainerScreen.html">third experiment</a> by creating three tabs.
</p>

<p>
    Later I extended the third experiment into <a href="../Experiments/AngularRouting/002-ContainerScreen.html">fourth experiment</a> by providing the login functionality.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="../Experiments/AngularRouting/003-ContainerScreen.html">fifth experiment</a> I added register functionality to the fourth experiment.
