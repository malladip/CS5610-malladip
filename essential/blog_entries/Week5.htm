<h2>Week 5</h2>

<p>
    I started off with the basic AngularJs directives in <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/001-HelloWorld.html">first experiment</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/002-AJAX.html">second experiment</a> is about dynamically getting data from another server using AJAX.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/003-LocalStorage.html">third experiment</a> I played around with local storage in the browser.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/004-DraggableContent.html">fourth experiment</a> I made a div sortable using JQuery.
</p>

<p>
    I played with angularJS more in my <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/005-OnScreenKeyboard.html">fifth experiment</a>. Here I made an onscreen keyboard.
