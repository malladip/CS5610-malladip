<h2>Week 4</h2>

<p>
    I started off with the basic AngularJs directives in <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/001-HelloWorld.html">first experiment</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/002-AJAX.html">second experiment</a> is about dynamically getting data from another server using AJAX.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs/003-LocalStorage.html">third experiment</a> I played around with local storage in the browser.
