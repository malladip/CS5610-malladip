<h2>Week 4</h2>

<p>
    I started off with JQuery by trying to display the current time of the user in my <a href="../Experiments/JQuery/001-CurrentTimeDynamic.html">first experiment</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/JQuery/002-GeoLocation.html">second experiment</a> is about embedding the google maps in our page.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="../Experiments/JQuery/003-LoginPage.html">third experiment</a> I played around with JQuery animations and updating the DOM dynamically.
</p>

<p>
    I always wanted to embedd a youtube video into my page. In my <a href="../Experiments/JQuery/004-EmbedYoutubeVideo.html">fourth experiment</a> I tried taking a youtube URL, and embedding the same video into my page.
</p>

<p>
    I extended the fourth experiment into <a href="../Experiments/JQuery/005-YoutubeVideoDragResize.html">fifth experiment</a> by making the embeded videos draggable and resizable.
