<h2>Week 7</h2>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/AngularJs-CSS/001-ContainerScreen.html">first experiment</a> this week about changing the CSS dynamically while using an AngularJS.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="../Experiments/AngularRouting/004-ContainerScreen.html">second experiment</a> I made a AJAX call to get the youtube video data.
</p>

<p>
    I extended the second experiment by adding the feature of favorites for registered users. This is my <a href="../Experiments/AngularRouting/005-ContainerScreen.html">third experiment</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My <a href="../Experiments/nodeJS/public/001-Notes.html">fourth experiment</a> is about using NodeJs and Explore and running on local server.
</p>

<p>
    I hosted my fourth experiment in to the openshift server. This is my <a href="../Experiments/nodeJS/public/002-Notes-Hosted.html">fifth experiment</a>.
